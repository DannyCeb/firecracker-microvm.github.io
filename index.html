                <header>Firecracker is an open-source virtualization technology that is purpose-built for creating and managing secure, multitenant containers and functions-based services.</header>
                <section>
                    <p>AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate are built on Firecracker. Until now, you needed to make a tradeoff between fast startup times and security. Containers offer fast startup times, while VMs offer hardware virtualization-based security boundaries that are more secure. In addition, the memory overhead of existing virtualization technologies makes it difficult to pack a high density of VMs onto a single machine for efficient hardware utilization. Firecracker enables you to deploy workloads in lightweight virtual machines, called microVMs, which combine the security and workload isolation properties of traditional VMs with the speed and resource efficiency of containers.</p>
                    <p>Firecracker implements a virtual machine monitor (VMM) based on the Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) to create and manage microVMs. Firecracker has a minimalist design. It excludes unnecessary devices and guest functionality to reduce the memory footprint and attack surface area of each microVM.  This improves security, decreases the startup time, and increases hardware utilization. Firecracker currently supports Intel CPUs, with planned AMD and ARM support. Firecracker will also be integrated with popular container runtimes. Our latest roadmap can be found <a href="#">here</a></p>

                    <p>Firecracker runs in the user space and leverages the Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) to create microVMs. The fast startup time and low memory overhead of each microVM enables you to pack thousands of microVMs onto the same machine. This means that every function or container group can be encapsulated with a virtual machine barrier, enabling workloads from different customers to run on the same machine, without any tradeoffs to security or efficiency. Firecracker is an alternative to QEMU, an established VMM with a general purpose and broad feature set that allows it to host a variety of guest operating systems.</p>
                    <p>You can control the Firecracker process via a REST-ful API that enables common actions such as configuring the number of vCPUs or starting the machine. It provides built-in rate limiters, which enable the fair sharing of network and storage resources by thousands of microVMs on the same machine. You can create and configure rate limiters via the Firecracker API and define flexible rate limiters that support bursts or specific bandwidth/operations limitations. Firecracker also provides a metadata service that securely shares configuration information between the host and guest operating system. You can set up and configure the metadata service using the Firecracker API.   </p>

                        <header>Why did we develop Firecracker?</header>
                        <section>Customers have told us that existing container security boundaries do not offer sufficient isolation between their applications when all containers have to use a shared operating system (OS) kernel. Containers offer fast startup times, while VMs offer hardware virtualization-based security boundaries that are more secure. Firecracker is a new virtualization technology that enables service owners to operate multi-tenant container-based services on bare metal machines by combining the speed, resource efficiency, and performance enabled by containers with the security and workload isolation properties of traditional VMs. </section>

                        <section>Firecracker was built at Amazon Web Services to enable AWS services such as AWS Fargate and AWS Lambda to improve resource utilization and customer experience. Firecracker is based on Chromium OSs' Virtual Machine Monitor (crosvm), an open-sourced VMM written in Rust. Today, crosvm and Firecracker have diverged to serve very different customer needs. We plan to contribute back the bug fixes and tests added to shared crates, and any Firecracker functionality that's appealing for crosvm.</section>

                        <section>Kata Containers is an OCI-compliant container runtime that executes containers within QEMU based virtual machines. Firecracker is a cloud-native alternative to QEMU that is purpose-built for running containers safely and efficiently, and nothing more. Firecracker has provides a minimal required device model to the guest operating system while excluding non-essential functionality (there are only 4 emulated devices: virtio-net, virtio-block, serial console, and a keyboard controller used only to stop the microVM). This, along with a streamlined kernel loading process enables a < 125 ms startup time and a reduced memory footprint. The Firecracker process also provides a RESTful control API, handles resource rate limiting for microVMs, and provides a microVM metadata service to enable the sharing of configuration data between the host and guest.</section>
